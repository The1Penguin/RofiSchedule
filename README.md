# RofiSchedule
A program that will interact with rofi to show the schedule for the day.

This project was originally inspired by [this project](https://github.com/adelhult/welcome-bot/) when I used a moded version of the bot's schedule module to achieve my intended use case.
The script was however slow so I decided to try and create it in rust, a language that I only know a little bit about.
I spent around an afternoon to get to know the libraries that I decided to use.
